## Prof. Dr. Hua Feng (Tsinghua)

#### Reopening the window of astronomical X-ray polarimetry with PolarLight

Polarimetry in the X-ray band is argued to be a powerful and sometimes 
unique tool in diagnosing the magnetic field, geometry and emission 
mechanism in astrophysics. PolarLight, which is a miniature X-ray 
polarimeter onboard a CubeSat, is the first dedicated astronomical X-ray 
polarimeter since the OSO-8 experiment in 1970s. It was launched into a 
low-Earth orbit in October 2018 and is still working in space. In this 
talk, I will introduce the PoarLight space program and the science 
results that have been obtained with it.
