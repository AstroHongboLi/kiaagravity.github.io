## Prof. Huanyuan Shan (SHAO)

#### Weak lensing with the Kilo-Degree Survey

Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful techniques to probe cosmology. In this talk, I will first  briefly review the current status of weak lensing surveys. Then I will present the recent cosmological parameter constraints using the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). The results of different statistical quantities can find the S8 tension in comparison with the Planck CMB measurements, indicating that the Universe is more homogeneous than the Î›CDM predicts.
