## Dr. Dicong Liang (PKU-KIAA)

#### Constraint on Brans-Dicke theory from Intermediate/Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals with self-force method

Intermediate/Extreme mass ratio inspiral (IMRI/EMRI) system provides a good tool to test the nature of gravity in strong field. We construct the self-force and use the self-force method to generate accurate waveform templates for IMRIS/EMRIs on quasi-elliptical orbits in Brans-Dicke theory. The extra monopole and dipole emissions in Brans-Dicke theory accelerate the orbital decay, so the observations of gravitational waves may place stronger constraint on Brans-Dicke theory. With a two-year observations of gravitational waves emitted from IMRIs/EMRIs with LISA, we can get the most stringent constraint on the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter Ï‰_0>10^5.
