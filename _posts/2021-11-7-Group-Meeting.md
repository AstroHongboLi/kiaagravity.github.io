## Invited Talk

#### Enping Zhou: Threshold mass of prompt collapse for binary quark star mergers

**Abstract** Mergers of binary compact stars are probes for the equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter in the multi-messenger astronomy era. In particular, if the total mass of the merging binary is higher than a threshold mass, which depends on the EoS of the compact star, a black hole is formed without any delay after the merger. In this prompt collapse case, both the gravitational wave and electro-magnetic counterparts will be significantly different from a delayed collapse case, hence providing robust information on the EoS. In this talk, I will introduce our efforts in modifying our numerical relativity code SACRA-MPI, which allows us to perform full GR-hydrodynamic simulations of binary quark star (which has a finite surface density) mergers for the first time, and the results on investigating the threshold mass of prompt collapse for quark stars.
