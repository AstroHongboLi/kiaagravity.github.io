#### Cosmological Inference using Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens

The observation of binary neutron star merger GW170817 provides the first
constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ using bright counterpart standard siren
method. For the case of a dark standard siren, where an electromagnetic
counterpart is not identified, a statistical method with a galaxy catalog can
be exploited to estimate Hubble constant. With multiple events, a combined
posterior can be obtained using Bayesian framework. In this lunch talk, I will
walk you through the Hubble constant inference via a series of mock data
challenges from O2-like detectability simulation of hundreds of binary neutron
star mergers, using both the counterpart and the statistical standard siren
methods and with focuses on gravitational wave selection and electromagnetic
selection effects. I will also talk about Hubble constant measurement with real
gravitational wave detections from LIGO.
