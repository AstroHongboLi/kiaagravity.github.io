#### The Physics of Superluminous Supernovae

Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) is a type of stellar explosion with a
luminosity 10 or more times higher than that of normal supernovae. The
physical origins of the extreme luminosity emitted by SLSNe are a hot topic
in astrophysics research. In this talk, I will introduce multiple models
for what conditions may produce an SLSN, including core collapse in
particularly massive stars, millisecond magnetars, interaction with
circumstellar material (CSM model). In addition, I will introduce a general
theory of homologous explosions with constant opacity, paying special
attention on the evolution of the photospheric radius. We find that
regardless of the density distribution profile, the photosphere always
increases early on and decreases at late times. This general behavior can
be used to quickly diagnose whether the source originates from a
supernova-like explosion.
