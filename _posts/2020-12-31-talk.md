## Prof. Dr. Rusen Lu (SHAO)

#### Imaging nearby supermassive black holes and their immediate neighborhoods with millimeter-VLBI

Imagingnearby supermassive black holes and their immediate neighborhoods
provides a new astrophysical laboratory to test general relativity in a
strong gravitational field regimeand probe the physical processes of mass
accretion and jet genesis on eventhorizon scales. Very Long Baseline
Interferometry at millimeter wavelengths offers the highest spatial
resolution achievable in astronomy. In recent years, mm-VLBI, represented
by the Event Horizon Telescope(EHT), has made unprecedented progress
towards imaging nearby supermassive black holes. The recent release of the
first-ever black hole image by theEHT collaboration marks a new culmination
of decades of global effort, whichprovides the first visual evidence for
the existence of black holes and adirect test of general relativity in a
strong field. In this talk, I willdiscuss some recent progress and future
opportunities in imaging the centralengines of nearby Active Galactic
Nuclei.
