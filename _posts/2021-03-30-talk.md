#### Looking for sub-solar mass black hole merger with LIGO and Virgo

Up to now LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has detected dozens of
gravitational wave events, all are mergers of binary black holes or neutron
stars. Yet, the detectors are sensitive to more sources from hypothesis,
thus enabling us to look for new physics. In this talk I will describe a
recent work where we searched for evidence of gravitational waves from
sub-solar mass compact binary coalescence, which can be emitted by merger
of primordial black holes. We didnâ€™t find any statistical significant
events, thereby put an upper limit on the event rate of such sources.
