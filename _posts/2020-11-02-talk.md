## Prof. Dr. Jia Liu (Peking University)

#### The quest of dark sectors from the Sun

Dark sectors consist of new light weakly coupled particles that do not
interact with the known Standard Model gauge forces. Searching for dark
sector particles, including dark matter itself and other associated states,
is a central goal of many experimental programs around the world. The
particle physics experiments at the intensity frontier try to explore them
using intense particle beams and highly sensitive detectors, while the
astrophysical objects can also serve as laboratories to test the dark
sector forces and particles. In this talk, we will explore the physics
opportunities of dark sector from the Sun, as an example of the interplay
between particle physics and astrophysics.
