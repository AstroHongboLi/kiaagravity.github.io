## About Group Meetings

Group meeting provides a friendly environment to interact with other group
members or visiting scholars.  It also brings the opportunity to broaden views
in science, to learn different methods in solving problems, to strengthen the
capability in scientifically sound presentations, even to develop close
collaborations via inspiring discussions. 

Our group meetings take place in the <b>Room 208 at KIAA</b>. To avoid
conflicts with students' classes, the time is fixed to <b>Saturday
9:00â€”11:00</b>. It is suggested to use English whenever there are foreigners in the audience. Otherwise it is suggested to talk in Chinese, but use English in slides.
