#### First binary black hole coalescences

The direct detections of gravitational waves (GWs) by Advanced LIGO/Virgo
have opened a new era in astronomy. The discovery of an unexpected
population of massive binary BHs (BBHs) constraints their formation pathway
and requires massive star formation in low-metallicity environments. In
this talk, I discuss low-metallicity massive star formation in the early
universe, so called Population III stars (PopIII stars), and binary
evolution of massive PopIII stars into colliding BBHs. Intriguingly, PopIII
binary model can explain the natures of coalescing BBHs observed by
LIGO/Virgo, in terms of the merger event rate and BH mass distribution. A
majority of the first binary BHs form and merge in the early universe. We
have suggested that such individually unresolved GWs develop a GW
background, which would be detectable by O5 LIGO/Virgo observation. More
interestingly, the BH population producing the GW background will also be
probed by the observations of the cosmic microwave background, on which
stellar activities of the first stars are directly imprinted.
